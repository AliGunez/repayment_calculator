Repayment Calculator

This is a simple Python script that calculates the least amount of transactions needed for a group of friends to pay each other back after participating in a group activity. The script takes in the individual expenses and determines who has to pay whom so that everyone ends up paying an equal amount for the activity.
Features

    Calculates the total and average amount spent
    Sorts the list of participants from highest to lowest spender
    Determines the least amount of transactions needed to balance the expenses

How to use

    Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3.x is recommended).
    Enter the names and individual expenses for each participant when prompted.
    Add as many purchases as you need by entering 'yes' or 'no' when prompted.
    The script will display the transactions needed for everyone to pay an equal amount.
